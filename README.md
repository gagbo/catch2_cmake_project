# Basic Catch2 C++ project

This project aims to be a good starting point when developing a new app in C++.
The structure is inspired by this
[good tutorial](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/chapters/basics/structure.html)

Note that this version needs CMake 3.11+ since I rely on FetchContent module
to pull Catch2 repository at configure time.
